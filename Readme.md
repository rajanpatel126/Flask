- This is the **Flask** learning.
- Flask has two components:
  1. WSGI: Web Server Gateway Interface
  2. Jinja2: Template

**WSGI**: to handle the request and response between the client and the server. It can process one request at a time.

**Jinja**: Can help to build dynamic webpages, support inheritance and can help to reduce the repetativeness of the code and it's complexity.

_Two kinds of Parameters_

1. Path parameters: Use to access the perticular endpoint
2. Query parameters: Filtering the data of perticular endpoint

\***\* Use of Conditional clause to start the server \*\***

- The app.run() command must be in the if **name** == "**main**" statement.
- Unlike JavaScript where each file is saperate module by default, Python files can be imported inside other file.
- If the script is imported as a module into another Python script, **name** is set to the name of the file.

_Path Parameter_

- The (string) parameters can be passed in the end point using <> brackets.
- To pass the parameters of the specific type, we need to mention the datatype, eg "<int:num>"

-> For the different endpoints, we can not have the same calling function.
-> While server is running, any the changes in the file will be saved automatically except the web page needs to be refreshed manually.

**Difference between Path Parameters and Dynamic URL**

- In the context of the web development, to say the Path parameters and dynamic url are the same thing.
- Path parameters are the variable emebeded in the query, while dynamic url are the url that change according to user input.
- e.g., "@app.route('/user/<int:user_id>')", here, /user/123 is a dynamic URL, while <int:user_id> is a path parameter.s

**URL Redirection**

- The URL can be redirected to another url using 'redirect' package of Flask.
- Instead of writing the url manually, we can use url_for to automatically find the corresponding redirected URL.
- We need to use function name of the specific route for the redirection.

**Templates**

- The HTML structure of each and every page is stored in a saperate file called as templates.
- Default naming convention of the folder is itself, 'templates', otherwise needs to be mention about the folder in the app.
- Importing all the templates using 'render_template' package.

- Instead of repetating the layout of html pages, the better way would be to save the layout in one file and extend it wherever we need.
- If we want to display some content specific to the pages, then we can use block to show it. e.g., {%block variable%}... {%endblock variable%}

_If-else block_

- The if-else block will start with {%if%} and ends with {%endif%}, to add elseif statement in between we can write like {%elif%}.

_For loop_

- The for loop has the similar syntax like if-else block that is, {%for%} and ends with {%endfor%}

\***\*CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) Attack\*\***

**How it works?**

- A type of an attack where attaker tricks the end-user by performing unintended actions over web application specially when web applications are taking input eg., forms
- An attacker generates an email or a website containing the link containing the request message.
- When a user clicks on it, they will redirected to the web-application, a request will be invoked. The server will have a request from the user, and server will response to that request which is eiter the leakage of the data or some sort of transaction.

**How to prevent?**

- CSRF token : a long, unpredictable string generated at server side when user sign-in for the 1st time and send it back to user's browser.
- Whenever making a request to the server, the CSRD token is must.
- If the token matches with the existing token at server, only then the request will be processed otherwise not.
- So now the token are at two places: with user and at server. If an attacker wants to attack, unless user has shared the token it will be impossible for attacker to attack because to get it from the server, you still need that token.

\***\*WTForms\*\***

- A python liberary to manage, create, validate and handle webforms for python web development
- Supports input validation, CSRF security, integrated with flask (flask-wtf)
- Compliant with 'pythonic' coding style; treat forms as python class, work with forms as objects and attributes and no need to write extensive HTML code
